Brewmeister is a home brewer's batch management tool and record keeping system.

## Problem Statement  
Home brewing has become a very popular hobby for beer enthusiasts in the United States and around the world.
While making a batch of beer, there are many variables which require consistent, precise tracking while brewing a batch of beer. Currently, the preferred method for most home brewers is either a notebook or a paper form. This can lead to data loss, disorganized records, or a failure to track the brewing process at all resulting in poor quality home brew.

Brewmeister aims to simplify the tracking process, record keeping, and enable the Home Brewmaster to make adjustments to the brewing process over time.
