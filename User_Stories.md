####As a home brewer...
 
- I want to **create an account** so I can have access to the tools the site provides
- I want to **see a status overview of all of my batches** so I can easily see which batches need attention soon
- I want to **create a new batch** so I can begin tracking it through its journey (and then I can drink it!)
- I want to **update a batch** as it moves from one step to the next in the brewing process
- I want to **delete a batch** if I have made mistakes so I can start from scratch with my data entry
- I want to **track which batch is in which bottles** so I can find the beer I am looking for
- I want to **reset my password** if I forget it so I do not lose access to my information
- I want to **know what the weather was on the day I bottled the batch** so I can draw conclusions from historical weather data
- I want to **make notes about the process or other thoughts** so I can review what I did to the beer and why it may have turned out this way
- I want to **archive batches**  so they do not appear in my overview, but the data is not lost
- I want to **unarchive batches** so I can see them in the status overview again if I accidentally archived them
 
#### As a site administrator...
[maybe optional?]
- I want to **see all users of the site** and their information, including number of batches in progress
- I want to **remove users from the site** if necessary
